FluxPlore: Exploring the Dynamic Contexts of AI Behavior

# Description

FluxPlore is a ground-breaking project focused on uncovering, understanding, and documenting the emergent properties of AI behaviors, specifically in the context of language models. By creating a robust and comprehensive framework for testing potential context biases, FluxPlore strives to explore the shifting sands of AI cognition, charting how various factors dynamically influence AI responses.

# Main Aims

Uncover Contextual Influences: FluxPlore aims to delve deep into how context affects AI responses. By analyzing sequential ambiguity, contradictory information, multiple contexts, and more, the project seeks to uncover the various nuances of how context influences AI outputs.

Test AI Robustness: FluxPlore aims to develop a diverse range of tests to scrutinize AI performance under various contextual circumstances. These tests will not only gauge the AI's cognitive biases but also assess its adaptability and agility when faced with changing contexts.

Promote AI Fairness and Transparency: By providing insights into how AI models react to different contexts, FluxPlore aims to help develop strategies for mitigating undue biases, promoting fairer and more transparent AI systems for future generations.
